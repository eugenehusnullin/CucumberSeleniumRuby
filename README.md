I use windows 7 x64, even if I install chrome x32 it does not work,
chromedriver fires message "Chrome Automation Extension has crashed."
Work only in Firefox, for me.


I test the http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ web site. 
This web site is an example application that captures prominent and 
ugly functionality found on the web. Perfect for writing automated acceptance 
tests against.
